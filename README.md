Description of the test:
I use Java, TestNG and Maven in my test. I was writing it using Page Object Pattern. I chose TestNG, because it has better functions for tests like groups tests, parametrization and dependency.

Main purpose of the test is to show declined prompt when I use incorrect credit card during booking process.
